                    <h2 style="color:darkgrey">Hi, I'm Owen Carpenter.</h2>
                    <p>I'm a 20 year old Computer Science student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
                        Growing up, I was always interested in computers - whether it was for gaming, video creation, or music creation.
                        When it came time to decide what I wanted to study for college, Computer Science didn't come to me immediately.
                        For some reason, I didn't even realize it was an option. However, as soon as my dad pointed it out to me,
                        I was all for it.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>So far, CompSci has pushed me and caused me to grow in ways I couldn't have ever imagined for myself just a few years ago.
                        I've only just begun to break the surface with computers and programming, but already the vastness of the subject
                        amazes me every time I think about it. Although programming is my preference when it comes to my studies, the
                        benefits of understanding the low level hardware and theories of computation can not be denied.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3 style="color:darkgrey">Outside of school and my studies, I like to consider myself a musician, athlete, and gamer.</h3>
                     <br>
                    <p>
                        I have dedicated a lot of time over the past four years to studying the guitar and learning as much about it as I can. I can proudly say that it has been
                        the most beneficial undertaking in my life, as it has opened my ears up to so much different music, and caused my to open
                        my perspectives up to avenues of life that I would have never given a shot before.
                    </p>
                     <br>
                    <p>
                        I also like to frequent the gym. I highly recommend (and have been religiously following) Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 program. I can't recommend it enough.
                        The strength gains and simplicity of the program are not to be ignored.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        And after everything else in my typical day has wrapped up, I usually find myself in front of my monitor, playing video games with my
                        longtime group of friends. I have had an interest in this type of content creation (both game development and gameplay recording) for a long time,
                        and have even recorded and released some videos on Youtube when I was younger. As time goes forward, I would love to start streaming the games I play
                        by myself and with my friends, to archive our idiocy throughout the years.
